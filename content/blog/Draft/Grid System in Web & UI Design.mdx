## What is a Grid

Welcome back in this story, we are learning about what is grid, grid are discreditable, designed to create alarm and help you to create, order and organize the content of your design.

Whether you are creating a layout for print like magazine or combining images and text to design a landing page, you will. It was great to help you make design decision and create a good experience for the user. Using a grid eliminates random decision making instead of placing elements in random places by using grid properly, you will know exactly where to place elements like local menu items, head lines, body copy image and more. It will help speed up your design process.

Why grids matter in digital design grills help you shape and how did you do digital design? Without them, you will have no idea where to place elements. We need them to create good user experience so user know how to navigate to a website and find what they would need.

Cells also held what it comes to responsive design, while the desktop experience of the landing page might use a multiple column to span text and image across the design is to be flexible enough to condense down well to two to three columns on the table and one column on the mobile device.

Notice how the mobile grid becomes a stack like one column or to the grid in the example.

There are five main types of greed. Some are better than others for web design.

But do you have likely used all five at one point in your design career?

The first one is based language.

The second one is manuscript grid column.

Third one is column grade.

14 is modular grade and for a last one is critical grade.

Those five graphs are really important, but I think the column grade is really important to us.

Column grade is help break up the text, photos and illustration.

For websites, you can have anywhere from two to 12 or even 16 columns that span the weight of the landing

page.

You can place text and image within just a column, or they can spin across multiple column displays

between columns called girders.

They should be the same size across all.

Not all columns really have to be symmetrical.

For example, you can utilize and a symmetrical column grid where some are thinner while others are

wider, which can be useful depending on the heritage of your design asymmetry.

Column grid are commonly used on blogs sites where you have the main content in large two third container

of the layout, while the smaller third may be the sidebar that includes information about the blog

and the writer.

After you have done your research, maybe you want to explore some low fidelity while frame on paper

create a grid for your landing page.

It's one of the simplistic ones you created.

You won't have to think about it again for all subsequent landing pages before you start building.

Think about the grid for this, rather than leaving it to the end and try to make you want to design

it into a grid.

New design might feel confined by the idea of using grid, but you shouldn't. After you have created green, it is going to break it. But at least you are doing it intentionally, and there are reasons for design decision.

The more you use grid, the more you realize how each guide, and it will actually help you design better and faster. So those are all things about groups, so that means signing off.
