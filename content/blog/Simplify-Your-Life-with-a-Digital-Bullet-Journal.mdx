I'm going to keep this as concise and to the point. I really enjoy the idea of ​​journaling, but I don't enjoy how complicated and time consuming it can often end up becoming. The idea of ​​tracking tasks and tracking patterns is really powerful but it needs to be simple, or else it becomes unsustainable and overwhelming.

If you've heard of Ryder Carroll's Bullet Journal method using notebooks, here I've adapted and simplified a few things. It's actually a hybrid system with GTD method However, if you're just starting to journal, there are some important things to know.
## Intro to Journaling
If you are still a beginner in journaling, you need to realize the important thing that in life it is important for us to do what is called a habit, a routine, it is not necessary. 
## What application should I use?
What I mean is, use applications that you often use. Using a new tool is often difficult to get you to open the application regularly. So, why not just use the apps you use most often?

For example, if you have a notebook nearby and frequently write, use that instead. No need to buy a new book specifically for journaling. Or if you often use WhatsApp, create a group that only contains you and name the group "Journaling" or "Note", no need to install new applications. This will make the journaling process more natural and easier to carry out. That way, you can write your important things.

## Bullet Journaling

> _I_ once read that “_you write_ in _order_ to _learn_ how to _think_.” _Journaling_ is a _great way_ to _get_ in the _habit_ of _writing_.

Let's focus on weekly and daily. There are definitely Tasks, Events, Notes, and even Feelings in our daily lives, and it is important for us to. There is a term called [Rapid Logging](https://bulletjournal.com/blogs/faq/what-is-rapid-logging-understand-rapid-logging-bullets-and-signifiers) which is designed to capture and categorize our thoughts quickly.

This is My daily template 
```markdown
- [x]  Todo (List all the activities you successfully completed.)
x Not do (List all the activities you failed to accomplish.)
- Notes  (Write brief notes based on the 'Todo' and 'Not do' sections)
---  
Feeling: (Describe your emotions throughout the day.)
> Quote (Reflect on what you learned today/write down a motivational quote.)
```

The first part is a simple reflection, I reflect on what I have done and my own mistakes and then turn them into valuable learning experiences. the notes part is important to add notes, it's a reminder for tomorrow, evaluate important things, this part is as short as do and don't.

the second part is the core of the journaling, this method I got from a short video of someone on Instagram, where he added feelings in his bullet journal. Feeling section here...

Then the quote tells... We definitely learn something new every day, or maybe we conclude something on that day, in one sentence we learn something. This is what we focus on if one day we review our journaling that has passed.

## In addition to practicing self-exploration skills

It is very important for us to understand ourselves, self exploration. By journaling regularly we can keep track of the number of days we have lived, making us grateful for what we got today, so we can improve to know what was lacking yesterday and what needs to be improved the next day.
