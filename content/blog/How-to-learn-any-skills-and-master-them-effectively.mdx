I received this book as a gift from my lecturer because I got the highest score in our weekly exam. I received this gift from my lecturer a few months ago, and I recently spent some time reading it through. Instead of reviewing, I want to write ideas about specific learning to skills, this is also an exercise for my writing skills.

Apa itu ? ... The research delves into an intriguing commonality shared by Beyoncé, Michael Jordan, and Stephen Hawking - a connection that most people are unaware of. Drawing insights from the book "The Talent Code" by Daniel Coyle, we've discovered that highly talented individuals possess an abundance of a substance called myelin in their brains.

Myelin can be likened to a specialized muscle in the brain that stores and enhances specific skills. The thicker the myelin sheath surrounding the neural pathways associated with a particular ability, the more proficient an individual becomes in that area.Sederhananya adalah When we practice or engage in any skill, we stimulate myelin growth. This biological mechanism explains why these seemingly disparate figures - a pop icon, a basketball legend, and a theoretical physicist - all exhibit extraordinary talents in their respective fields.
## Break skills into smaller components, practice consistently

Break the skill into manageable chunks and focus on mastering each one individually before integrating them. Practice slowly and correctly, using mistakes as learning opportunities, since repeating mistakes can reinforce them. Consistent and proper repetition is essential for building competence and ultimately mastering the skill.

For example, I'm currently learning a new language . This involves breaking down the process into chunks: mastering vocabulary, understanding grammar rules, practicing pronunciation, and engaging in conversations. Trying to learn everything at once would be overwhelming and counterproductive. It will still take time to become fluent, but by focusing on one aspect at a time, the learning process becomes more manageable. 

Additionally, Josh Kaufman's ["The First 20 Hours"](https://wanderingaimfully.com/146-2/#:~:text=1.,a%20song%20in%2020%20hours.) highlights that with focused and deliberate practice, you can become reasonably proficient in a new skill in just 20 hours. This emphasizes the importance of breaking down the learning process and dedicating consistent, concentrated effort.
## Mastery is about deep practice

Talent is the result of deep practice. The best way to learn is with deliberate practice where you push yourself to the edge constantly. The more you practice deliberately, the faster and better you learn.

Everyone knows that practice is a key to success. What everyone doesn't know is that specific kinds of practice can increase skill up to ten times faster than conventional practice.

***Practice makes perfect***, indeed accurate but only if you practice in the right way, simply repeating a task won't lead to Improvement but making mistakes and correcting them will, when you practice beyond your current abilities, the nerves in your brain will light up through the circuits and the Myelin layer around the circuits becomes thicker.
## Ignition 
Ignition is a bit similar to motivation; we all need it to get things started. However, what separates truly high achievers from the rest of the pack? A higher level of commitment call it [passion](https://medium.com/@sargam0122/what-is-passion-f731df8e0cb) born out of our deepest unconscious desires and triggered by certain primal cues. Understanding how these signals work can help you ignite passion and catalyze skill development.

> _“High motivation is not the kind of language that ignites people. What works is precisely the opposite: not reaching up but reaching down, speaking to the ground-level effort, affirming the struggle.”_ Daniel Coyle
## Coaching 
Deep practice and ignition are essential for developing world-class skills. However, it’s equally vital to have the guidance of the right mentor(s) to direct your efforts effectively.

Coaches and mentors play pivotal roles in skill development, providing invaluable guidance tailored to individual strengths and weaknesses. They not only offer structured feedback but also impart wisdom accumulated through experience. This personalized direction helps navigate challenges more effectively and accelerates learning by focusing on refining specific aspects of the skill set.

These three elements—deep practice, ignition, and mentorship—interact synergistically within the brain to cultivate **myelin**, a microscopic neural substance crucial for enhancing speed and accuracy in movements and thoughts. Scientists suggest that myelin could be the foundation of greatness, facilitating achievements from artistic masterpieces like Michelangelo’s to athletic prowess like Michael Jordan’s. Importantly, myelin isn't fixed at birth; it grows with deliberate cultivation and nourishment, making continuous improvement and mastery achievable.

By combining insightful analysis with compelling examples of individuals who have achieved greatness, this approach not only reshapes perspectives on talent but equips individuals to realize their highest potential through deliberate practice and expert guidance.
