I received this book as a gift from my lecturer because I scored the highest on our weekly test. The lecturer gift to me I had heard about the book a couple of years ago, and then again recently. Howard Carrier (aka Hitter) recommended it to me too, so I figured it was time to take the plunge and added it to my Christmas list.

The research delves into an intriguing commonality shared by Beyoncé, Michael Jordan, and Stephen Hawking - a connection that most people are unaware of. Drawing insights from the book "The Talent Code" by Daniel Coyle, we've discovered that highly talented individuals possess an abundance of a substance called myelin in their brains.

Myelin can be likened to a specialized muscle in the brain that stores and enhances specific skills. The thicker the myelin sheath surrounding the neural pathways associated with a particular ability, the more proficient an individual becomes in that area.Sederhananya adalah When we practice or engage in any skill, we stimulate myelin growth. This biological mechanism explains why these seemingly disparate figures - a pop icon, a basketball legend, and a theoretical physicist - all exhibit extraordinary talents in their respective fields.

## Mastery is about deep practice
Talent is the result of deep practice. The best way to learn is with deliberate practice where you push yourself to the edge constantly. The more you practice deliberately, the faster and better you learn.

Everyone knows that practice is a key to success. What everyone doesn't know is that specific kinds of practice can increase skill up to ten times faster than conventional practice.

***Practice makes perfect***, indeed accurate but only if you practice in the right way, simply repeating a task won't lead to Improvement but making mistakes and correcting them will, when you practice beyond your current abilities, the nerves in your brain will light up through the circuits and the Myelin layer around the circuits becomes thicker.
The rules of deep practice

Choose one goal beyond your present abilities.
 • Chunk it up: Break the thing you're trying to master down into chunks and master them one by one, then put them back together.
 • Repetition: Repeat skills slowly and ensure to do them properly. Mistakes show a lack of competence in that area and should be viewed as an opportunity to improve. Repetition of mistakes will train the mistakes.
 • Feel the struggle: Pick a target, reach for it, and adjust as you go. 
 Jika merasa struggle/ struggle itu hal yang biasa, jika mengalaminya ubahlah planmu bukan goalmu
## Ignition
Ignition encompasses a broader meaning than motivation; we all need it to get things started. However, what separates truly high achievers from the rest of the pack? A higher level of commitment call it [passion](https://medium.com/@sargam0122/what-is-passion-f731df8e0cb) born out of our deepest unconscious desires and triggered by certain primal cues. Understanding how these signals work can help you ignite passion and catalyze skill development.

> _“High motivation is not the kind of language that ignites people. What works is precisely the opposite: not reaching up but reaching down, speaking to the ground-level effort, affirming the struggle.”_ Daniel Coyle
## Coaching
Deep practice and ignition are essential for world-class skills. However, it’s equally important to have the right mentor(s) to direct your efforts. Coaches play a crucial role in helping individuals reach their full potential. 

These three elements work together within your brain to form **myelin**, a microscopic neural substance that adds vast amounts of speed and accuracy to your movements and thoughts. Scientists have discovered that myelin might just be the holy grail: the foundation of all forms of greatness, from Michelangelo's to Michael Jordan's. The good news about myelin is that it isn't fixed at birth; to the contrary, it grows, and like anything that grows, it can be cultivated and nourished.  
  
Combining revelatory analysis with illuminating examples of regular people who have achieved greatness, this book will not only change the way you think about talent, but equip you to reach your own highest potential.
