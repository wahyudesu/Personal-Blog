As a developer, you know how important time is. Every second counts when you're coding, researching, or simply trying to get things done efficiently. That's where tools like [Fluent Search](https://fluentsearch.net) and [Flow Launcer](https://www.flowlauncher.com) can really help you be more productive. In this post, we'll look at how these tools can make your work easier and help you be more efficient.
## The problem
Opening a file on a Windows might seem easy, but it actually involves several steps. First, you use File Explorer to find the file, then double-click it. This process, which I studied in my third-year research project, is more complex than it seems.
1. Move the mouse to the file explorer logo, (someone may have a Windows+E) shortcut)
2. Click Documents
3. Click 'Semester 3'
4. Click 'Matkul Project'
5. Double click on 'Project matkul.pdf'

Opening a file usually takes 10-15 seconds, which seems short but adds up over time, especially considering the many small tasks we do on a computer. To save time, You can use Fluent Search, a Windows application that is like a faster version of Powertoys Run. You just type what you want to launch with a simple shortcut (Alt + Space). This is a great tool to make my time at the computer more efficient.
## Search everything
So how does Flow launcher work? what Flow Launcher does is pop up a small text window on your computer when you press a key command with the default (Ctrl+Alt), You can also change the hotkey like Alt+Space or Ctrl +Space.

You can quickly find and access various resources on your computer, including active processes, in-app elements, files, and web searches. It supports keyboard-based navigation, customizable interfaces, and search tags to filter results efficiently.

With Fluent Search **Coding Become Easier** As a coder, you know how frustrating it can be to sift through mountains of documentation and code snippets. Fluent Search makes this process a breeze by allowing you to search across multiple sources simultaneously. It helps find specific functions, examples, or bug solutions easily.

I can even do calculations a bit faster than having to open a calculator, translate faster, search for pages in notion, search for npm packages, search for anime in myanimelist, there are many plugins available

Previously I used flow, both are open source, **don't use power toys because it runs very slow**, both of them are great tools, I don't know which one works best, so I run both, more precisely I keep trying both without intending to uninstall one of them

I highly recommend to install one of the following
https://fluentsearch.net
https://www.flowlauncher.com
https://www.listary.com
but as far as I've tried it, fluent search has more features and customization.
